# 🚀 React Interview Question 3: Toast Notification Component 🚀

🎯 **React Interview Task – Question 3: Toast Notification Component**

This task is commonly asked in React interviews to evaluate a candidate’s knowledge of **React hooks**, **dynamic rendering**, and **timed state cleanup**. The goal is to build a custom Toast Notification System that displays temporary, dismissible messages on user interaction using **functional components**, **useRef**, and **useState**.
