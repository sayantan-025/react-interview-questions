# 🚀 React Interview Question 3: Toast Notification Component 🚀

🎯 **React Interview Task – Question 3: Toast Notification Component**

This task is commonly asked in React interviews to evaluate a candidate’s knowledge of **React hooks**, **dynamic rendering**, and **timed state cleanup**. The goal is to build a custom **Toast Notification System** that displays temporary, dismissible messages on user interaction using **functional components**, **useRef**, and **useState**.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

✅ Create a **Toast Notification Component** in React that:

- Renders different types of toasts: `success`, `info`, `warning`, and `error`
- Allows triggering toast messages via button clicks
- Automatically dismisses each toast after 5 seconds
- Allows manual dismissal using a close (×) button
- Uses `useRef` to manage multiple timeout IDs for cleanup
- Uses `useState` to handle the toast list dynamically
- Applies **clean CSS styling** for each type of toast

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- ⚡ **Interactive toast triggering** via buttons
- 🧠 Efficient **state and timeout management** with `useState` + `useRef`
- 💣 Auto-dismiss and **manual close** support
- 🧱 **Reusable component structure**
- 🎨 **CSS styling** for toast variants and transitions
- 🧪 Easy to extend for dynamic messages or toast queues

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts Tested

- React Functional Components
- `useState` for dynamic state
- `useRef` for managing timeouts
- List rendering and unique keys
- Timed effects and cleanup
- Component composition and communication
- Clean conditional rendering
